<p>Welcome to Northeastern Universityâ€™s SailBot club website.</p>
<p>The Focus of SailBot Club is to prepare a 1 Meter and 2 Meter boat for the International SailBot Competition. What specifically makes SailBot a difficult competition is that the boat is not only Remote Controlled but also must compete most competitions completely autonomously. 
    Thus, the boats computer takes into account variables such as wind direction, GPS location, and Compass heading in order to make decisions to sail to waypoints.</p>

<p>An improvement we will soon add is a increased surface area on the tail. As we have a program to average the encoder values and find a apparent wind direction.</p>
