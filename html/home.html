<p>Welcome to Northeastern Universityâ€™s SailBot club website.</p>
<p>The Focus of SailBot Club is to prepare a 1 Meter and 2 Meter boat for the International SailBot Competition. What specifically makes SailBot a difficult competition is that the boat is not only Remote Controlled but also must compete most competitions completely autonomously. 
    Thus, the boats computer takes into account variables such as wind direction, GPS location, and Compass heading in order to make decisions to sail to waypoints.</p>

<p>After much debate and about the proper way to make a wind vane, we decided to 3d print a model and test the weighting on it. </p>
<p>An improvement we will soon add is a increased surface area on the tail. As we have a program to average the encoder values and find a apparent wind direction.</p>

<p>All Systems Ready to go!</p>
<p>After much work putting most of the systems on an I2C bus, we managed to get all of the systems connected to the Arduino Mega Micro controller. We now have a solid flow of Inputs and outputs for the electrical system.</p>
<p>This is to say, that our inputs: GPS, compass, wind Encoder, and Xbee Radio are all feeding information into the Arduino every clock cycle, and/or every time we ping a request.</p>
