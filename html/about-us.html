<h2>Our History</h2>

<h2>Our Values</h2>
<p>Here at NU Sailbot, we share Northeastern's values:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Contribution - We aim to contribute to society by making a relatively efficient vessel that
	can navigate on its own. We can see real world applications of this such as conducting unmanned 
	investigations out at sea.</li>
	<li>Diversity - Our team consists of different cultures and majors, allowing for a broader 
	scope in our endeavors. We have people with majors varying from Computer and Mechanical 
	Engineering, to Chemistry and Computer Science.</li>
	<li>Engagement - Thanks to Northeasternâ€™s commitment to engagement, our team has more real 
	world experience than most colleges granted to us by our Co-Op program. Many of our members 
	bring with them real world experience from their participation in companies such as (fill in).
	</li>
	<li>Integrity - As with any good organization, integrity is also a key factor. We value honesty
	 between our members, our supporters, and in competition.</li>
	<li>Opportunity - As a Northeastern team, we pride ourselves on offering a variety of 
	opportunities to our members, whether it be teaching them an entirely new programming language 
	or giving them the chance to go sailing at a local pond. We like to think that we provide our 
	members with a road range of new experiences and learning.</li>
</ul>
