<h2>Our Team</h2>
<p>As a team we are made up of future engineers, scientists, programmers, and various other majors working together 
    to achieve our group goal: Make a completely autonomous SailBot. We meet every week to discuss plans and prepare the boat, though most of the hard work is done individually. 
    As a group, we enjoy sailing at the local Jamaica Pond, as well as the Charles River.</p>

<h2>Our History</h2>
<p>Our club was originally started by two Senior Mechanical Engineers (Charles O’Connor/Sean Suri) as their Capstone project. 
They soon fell in love with the group dynamic and gathered a group of interested Engineers. SailBot became an official recognized 
Club Fall 2013 with Justin Hynes-Bruell as President and Dan Thompson as Vice President. We initially rallied a massive group of 
around 50 interested students, though after experiencing the micromanagement involved, downsized the club to around 10 Solid members.</p>
<p>Joseph Lagalla will be leading the club forward until Spring 2015.</p>

<h2>Our Values</h2>
<p>Here at NU Sailbot, we share Northeastern's values:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Contribution - We aim to contribute to society by making a relatively efficient vessel that can navigate on its own. 
	    We can see real world applications of this such as conducting unmanned investigations out at sea..</li>
	<li>Diversity -  Our team consists of different cultures and majors, allowing for a broader scope in our endeavors. 
	    We have people with majors varying from Computer and Mechanical Engineering, to Chemistry and Computer Science.</li>
	<li>Engagement - Thanks to Northeastern’s commitment to engagement, our team has more real world experience than most 
	    colleges granted to us by our Co-Op program. Many of our members bring with them real world experience from their 
	    prior experiences.</li>
	<li>Integrity - As with any good organization, integrity is also a key factor. We value honesty
	 between our members, our supporters, and in competition.</li>
	<li>Opportunity - As a Northeastern team, we pride ourselves on offering a variety of 
	opportunities to our members, whether it be teaching them an entirely new programming language 
	or giving them the chance to go sailing at a local pond. We like to think that we provide our 
	members with a road range of new experiences and learning.</li>
</ul>
