    <p>The International Robotic Sailing Regatta is a robotic sailing competition historically held in North America in which 
        teams of university and college students compete. The first event, in 2006, was hosted by Queen’s University, Kingston, 
        Ontario and inspired by the success of a senior project at the University of British Columbia to build a robotic 
        sailboat. Teams have since annually competed throughout the US and Canada. The goal is to create an unmanned sailboat 
        that navigates through a variety of challenges with limited, if any, human control. Students are able to use this 
        friendly competition between schools to apply their engineering knowledge in a multi-disciplinary task that requires 
        mechanical, electrical, and software skill to deal with this highly variable environment.

    <p>The competition is open to the 1-meter, 2-meter SailBot Class, and an Open Class (which are boats up to 4 meters in 
        length – see the Class Rules for the actual requirements of each class).
