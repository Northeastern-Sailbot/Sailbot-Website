		NU Sailbot is a multi-disciplinary student robotics team that is
		designing a fully autonomous sailboat to compete in the annual
		International Robotic Sailing Competition. This student club is an
		opportunity for anyone interested in robotics, autonomy, sailing or
		naval architecture. SailBot is intended for students of all skill
		levels; from novice teams to veteran programmers and sailors.
		The competition includes both group and individual events for
		teams to demonstrate their work.

		We're eventually going to put in way more information here about the competition
